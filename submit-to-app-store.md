# Submitting your PWA to the iOS App Store

Once you've packaged your PWA for iOS using [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com) and [followed the steps to build your iOS app package](/next-steps.md#1-build-your-project-in-xcode), you can submit your app to the iOS App Store.

The process looks like this:

1. [Sign into your Apple Developer account](#1-sign-into-your-apple-developer-account)
2. [Create a Bundle ID](#2-create-your-bundle-id)
3. [Create a certificate signing request (CSR)](#3-create-a-certificate-signing-request-csr)
4. [Create a new certificate](#4-create-a-certificate)
5. [Create a provisioning profile](#5-create-a-provisioning-profile)
6. [Create an app reservation](#6-create-your-app-reservation)
7. [Upload your app package](#7-upload-your-app-package)

Each step is described below.

## 1. Sign into your Apple Developer account

To submit your app the iOS App Store, [sign-in to your Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/).

If you don't have an Apple Developer account, [enroll here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll). Enrollment costs $99 USD/year, though [non-profits can have this fee waived](https://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/).

## 2. Create your Bundle ID

Once you're signed in, you'll need to create a Bundle ID for your app. 

> 💁‍♀️ What's a Bundle ID?
> 
> A Bundle ID is a string (e.g. com.myawesomepwa) that uniquely identifies your app in the App Store.
> Apple recommends using a reverse-domain style string, such as com.domainname.appname.
>
> This string must be the same string you used in PWABuilder when packaging your iOS app. By default, PWABuilder uses the reverse-domain of your PWA as your Bundle ID.
>
> If you're unsure what value you should use as your Bundle ID, go back to PWABuilder, package for iOS, and take note of the Bundle ID in PWABuilder's iOS options dialog.

Go to your [Apple Developer account page](https://developer.apple.com/account/) and choose `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles` to create your Bundle ID.

Then choose `Identifiers` and click `+` to add a new identifier.

Choose `App IDs`, then choose `App` as the type. You'll be prompted for a `Description` and `Bundle ID`.

Add any `Description` you like, then paste in your Bundle ID into the `Identifier` text box:

> 💁‍♂️ Remember, **`Bundle ID` must be set to the same value you used when generating your package in PWABuilder.**
> 
> If you're unsure what your Bundle ID is, go back to PWABuilder, package for iOS, and take note of your `Bundle ID`.
> 
> Alternately, you can find your Bundle ID inside your `project.pbxproj` file, next to the `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` string.

Under `Capabilities`, **enable** the following capabilities:

- Associated Domains
- Push Notifications

Click `Continue` and then `Register` to finish creating your Bundle ID.

## 3. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

On your Mac, launch `Keychain Access` app. 

From the top menu bar, choose `Keychain Access` -> `Certificate Assistant` -> `Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority`
